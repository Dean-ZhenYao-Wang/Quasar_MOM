This directory contains the MESA B2MML and BatchML V0600 documentation files.  
The files follow the naming convention established in the initial releases of B2MML to include the version number in the file name.
This was done in order to make it easier for users to focus on a specific version for their development, without having to actually 
read or open the files to determine the version.  While every attempt has been made to maintain backwards compatability, this has not
always been possible due to the changes in the underlying ANSI/ISA 95 and ANSI/ISA 88 standards. Therefore the version numbers of
B2MML and BatchML can be tied to specific releases of the underlying standards.  
V0600 is derived from ANSI/ISA 95 Part 2 ed2 (May 2010) and ANSI/ISA 945 Part 4 (May 2012) and ANSI/ISA 95 Part (July 2013)
